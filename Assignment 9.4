#9.4 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and 
#figure out who has the sent the greatest number of mail 
#messages. The program looks for 'From ' lines and takes the 
#second word of those lines as the person who sent the mail. 
#The program creates a Python dictionary that maps the 
#sender's mail address to a count of the number of times they 
#appear in the file. After the dictionary is produced, the 
#program reads through the dictionary using a maximum loop to 
#find the most prolific committer.
